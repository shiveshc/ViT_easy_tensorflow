# ViT_easy_tensorflow
Native TensorFlow API implementation of Vision Transformer paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf).

The goal of this implementation is instructional. I hope it is useful for people who do not have deep background in Pytorch or Keras. This implementation defines model graph using native TensorFlow API (one single file) thus may be easier to understand the method for beginners.
